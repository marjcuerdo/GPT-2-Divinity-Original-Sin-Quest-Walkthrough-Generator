# GPT-2 Divinity: Original Sin Quest Walkthrough Generator

Being a fan of open-world RPGs, I really enjoyed playing through the DOS games. With DOS being known for having quests that can be completed in almost any fashion, I thought it'd be humurous to create a walkthrough instructions generator for quests in the games.

This notebook is created by Marjorie Ann Cuerdo and adopted from Max Woolf's: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce.

Open the modified Google Colab Notebook and follow the instructions there to run it using Colab's GPU (helpful for people like me without GPUs).
