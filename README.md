# GPT-2 Divinity: Original Sin Quest Walkthrough Generator

Being a fan of open-world RPGs, I really enjoyed playing through the [DOS](http://www.divinityoriginalsin.com/) games. With DOS being known for having quests that can be completed in almost any fashion, I thought it'd be humurous to create a walkthrough instructions generator for quests in the games.

Follow the instructions below to generate quest walkthrough text from the Divinity: Original Sin game series (DOS and DOS2) using the GPT-2 model. The text is derived from [Divinity Wiki](https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Divinity_Wiki).

This notebook (link here: https://github.com/marjcuerdo/GPT-2-Divinity-Original-Sin-Quest-Walkthrough-Generator/blob/main/GPT_2_for_Divinity_Original_Sin_Series_Quest_Walkthrough_Generator.ipynb) is created by Marjorie Ann Cuerdo and adopted from Max Woolf's: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce.

Open the modified Google Colab Notebook named ("GPT_2_for_Divinity_Original_Sin_Series_Quest_Walkthrough_Generator.ipynb") and follow the instructions there to run it using Colab's GPU (helpful for people like me without GPUs).
